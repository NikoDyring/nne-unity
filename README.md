# NNE Unity Assignment

By Nikolaj Dyring Jensen

## Controls

**WASD** - For moving your player.
**E** - For interacting.
**ESC** - For closing the UI Window.

## Considerations

1. Since the testscene is very flat and has no stairs/slopes, I've decided not to implement gravity / stepping on the player controller. This would be easy to implement in the future if the needs were to come.

## Other Comments
For some reason my colored cubes has switched between the green and the blue one. I haven't had the time to look further into this issue due to a lot of my time went for the transforming of the ModelToAlign. Furthermore a lot of the time was reading up on documentation for Mirror as I've never touched that framework before and has primarily only got 2D experience in terms of Unity. It was quite the challenge, but I hope you guys find it as good of a solution as I found it interesting.
