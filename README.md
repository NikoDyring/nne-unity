# NNE Unity Assignment

By Nikolaj Dyring Jensen

## Controls

**WASD** - For moving your player.
**E** - For interacting.

## Considerations

1. Since the testscene is very flat and has no stairs/slopes, I've decided not to implement gravity / stepping on the player controller. This would be easy to implement in the future if the needs were to come.
